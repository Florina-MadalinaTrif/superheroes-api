  Project hosting and testing details:
    - Can be tested live on my personal domain: https://superhero-app.florinatrif.com
    - The API is hosted on Railway.
    - The Client is hosted on Vercel.

  Bonus points:
    - Added server side validation for the humility score(1-10) and for the other 2 fields a NotEmpty check, and dislayed the messages in the React interface.
    - Wrote a brief E2E test using Jest and Supertest to simulate 2 POST requests and check the responses.
  
  If I had more time:
    If I had more time to spend on this project, I would:
    API: Create a real database instead of using an in-memory array. I would choose PostgreSQL and an ORM like Prisma, for better data persistence and scalability.
    Client: I would use the Tailwind CSS library to improve the user interface.

  Team player attitude:
    As part of a collaboration with a teammate, we would:
      - First and foremost: set up a source control enviroment using git.
      - Split the responsabilities: Frontend - Backend.
      - Discuss features and requirements and create an Agile board using Trello for task management.
